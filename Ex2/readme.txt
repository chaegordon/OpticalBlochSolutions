#Excercise 3

#Code was adapted from an example online which which created a tophat, this was fourier transformed using the FFT function
#this was then shifted to include negative and postive frequencies

#the plot showed the expected sinc function in the far field regime

#the source code for this was task9.py

#For the second core task the field was modified by multiplying the tophat by a complex phase fact with the phase as specified
#in the handout (a sine function). The fourier transform was carried exactly the same.

#The source code for this was task10.py

#For the supplementary task the field was yet again multiplied by another complex phase factor, this time with a quadratic 
#dependance on x.

#The source code for this was task11.py
