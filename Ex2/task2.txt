#Exercise 2
#Core Task 2

#The four loop that generated values for various thet0s was removed and theta0 was initialised at the start of the code.
#It was seen that for high damping the period was too long and a divide by zero error was seen, this was fixed
#by increasing theta0 to 0.5.

#The plots showed that q=1 was underdamped, while the others (q=5,10) were overdamped with the time to return to equillibrium
#increasing as q was increased. This was as expected.

#q was then set to 0.5 and F changed to 0.5, 1.2, 1.44, 1.465
#The period was calculated using the same method as core task 1

#the following values were recorded for q=0.5: 
#F  		T
#0.5		8.869
#1.2		9.175
#1.44		9.006
#1.465		8.998

#The plots showed quite specific shapes with the F=1.44 and 1.465 clearly wrapping around. The increase followed by
#decrease trend is explained by the period increasing as we approach wrap around as the pendulum slows as it passes
#90 degrees and the decreasing as we wrap around and the increasing F causes it to wrap around quicker.
